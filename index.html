   <h3>Welcome to Bella's Weekly Web Design Blogs. Follow Along as I learn and share my skills of web design.</h3>
<br> 
   <h4>Week 1: Introduction</h4>
   <p>I found this week's content exciting and thrilling. I was excited to participate and complete the web design paper and expand my own knowledge around web design. As a communication major student who loves graphic design, I was looking forward to taking a course that breaks away from my comfort zone within design. The skills and knowledge I will learn in this course will help strengthen my graphic design and impact my work in the future. I want to grasp a better understanding of web design and learn more about the smaller details of website function and user experience rather than just focusing on the appearance of design. Completing the ice breaker challenge during class was helpful and allowed me to feel comfortable and familiar with my classmates and tutors. I found it interesting seeing all the majors and design backgrounds of others as well as having others similar to myself. </p>
<br>
<h4>Week 2: Understanding Users</h4>
<p>After last week, I am excited and ready to jump into assignment one as well as learning more around the history of web design. I found it interesting how much web design had adapted over time and the large amount of progress that was created. The world wide web was created in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee and was used to share information from one scientist to another. I found it interesting that the internet was only created 33 years ago and how much it had taken over our lives and I was wondering how much more the internet has to progress and improve in the future. I found the persona activity really enjoyable. It was fun creating a person and having complete creative freedom to build a character with different beliefs and attributes. It allowed me to learn more about others different to myself and how everyone has different user experiences. </p>

<h4>Week 3: Goals</h4>
<p>After creating personas and grasping a better understanding of web design, this week focused around goals and how they can impact people's decisions. I found it very interesting learning the difference between qualitative and quantitative goals and the importance of both of them within web design. Allowing for a website to have aesthetic appearances and appealing visually to the users as well as being realistic and knowledgeable with the data that is being shared. Creating a venn diagram helped visually communicate a user's goals and compare them with a designer. Using the personas we had already created, we created goals for each user. We then created goals for a designer creating a specific website and found similarities between both the user and designers goals. I now understand the importance of web design goals as it allows for the function of the website to flow and work well for the specific audience of users. </p>

<h4>Week 4: Journey Maps & User Flow</h4>
<p>Creating journey maps and user flows also helped expand deeper my knowledge and understanding of how different people need to function with certain websites. A journey map helped showcase the different steps users take when navigating a web page. This allowed me to see any smaller details I missed and important aspects of the website that need to be added. I started to see a flow within assignment one and how each diagram can help and impact the next. User flows also allow to show different routes that can be taken when interacting with a web page. Overall I found this week very helpful as it allowed me to start to see how my assignment one was coming along and creating ideas of how a website designed by me could function.

<h4>Week 5: Assignment 1 Support</h4>
<p>This week was focused around assignment one hand in and gathering feedback from my pairs. I had created my character persona which led to creating venn diagrams, user flows and journey maps. This process helped me understand what issues can be seen for a user and allow me to create an idea for a website. I found the process and use of diagrams very helpful when understanding issues that can occur for certain users. I have also been enjoying the coding lecture content and slowly starting to understand code. As a graphic designer, I haven't done much work around coding therefore I am enjoying learning something new and allowing myself to break out of my comfort zone. I’m starting to understand basic code and how it can be applied, however I am still beginning and will need to refresh myself on the coding lectures as I continue in this course. </p>
<br>
<h4>Week 6: Assignment 2.1 Brief, Colour & Typography</h4>
<p>This week focused around the beginning of assignment 2.1 and the use of colour and typography in web design. I’m excited to start planning my design process and appearance of my website. Learning about colour and typography helped expand my knowledge and improve my design process around creating design styles for the brand as well as layout options for wireframes. I am now able to start seeing how my website will come together through the use of colour and certain fonts. I also found it interesting learning about accessibility and understanding how to cater to different disabilities such as struggling to read small fonts to allow for the colours and layout to be clear and understandable. It made me appreciate that design is more than just appearance, it's about function. </p>
<br>
<h4>Week 7: Composition & Assignment 2.1 Submission</h4>
<p>Grids and layouts were a big part of this week's content that I found most interesting and useful. It helped me understand again the importance of design layouts and details rather than just visual appearance. The use of grids can allow for even spacing between content such as images and can ensure nothing overlaps and is therefore difficult to understand. This can also be used when implying visual hierarchy to designs. Within web design, visual hierarchy can be used to ensure that important information is seen first due to the layout option as well as design of the information. Learning about this will help me when creating my final design as well as web design work I may do in the future. </p>
<br>
<h4>Weel 8: Assignment 2.2 Brief</h4>
<p>This week looked into the beginning of assignment 2.2 and the creation of my final website. With the plan I have created I can start to create a final design and apply all the knowledge and skills I learnt so far in web design to ensure my website functions well. I have decided to complete this assignment in CMS as I feel my coding abilities are still improving and I feel I would benefit from more time learning code and applying my better knowledge to my final blog assignment. Using a program such as editor x will allow me to focus more around the design of my website and ensuring all skills of layout, colour and type can be applied whilst focusing on my personas approach and impact to the website. </p>

<h4>Week 9: Responsive Design & Labelling Files</h4>
<p>As a designer I felt my knowledge around responsive design and filing was small and I didn’t allow myself to fully understand the importance of it. This week's content has been very interesting as I have learnt how to embrace something new. When creating my final website I didn't understand that layouts can be different depending on the size of the screen the user is using. Making sure that all social platforms and technologies are covered will allow for the website to have more demand and flow more easily for each user. I also found it interesting how important it is to save and keep documents and create an organised way to manage them. I learnt the difference between different file types and when to use certain ones. Overall, this week's content helped ensure that I was focusing on every small detail when designing my final website. </p>
<br>
<h4>Week 10: Assignment 2.2 Submission & Weekly Blog Summary</h4>
<p>Overall with assignment 2.2, I have really enjoyed creating my website and watching it all come together. The knowledge I have learnt so far in this course has really helped improve my design as well as myself as a designer. Using my design plan and wireframes, creating my final design has been easy and has allowed me to reach out for feedback from my pairs and have another pair of eyes review my work as if they were another user. Overall I have really enjoyed this assignment and creating my final work. </p>
<br>
<h4>Week 11: Assignment 2.2 Presentations & Coding</h4>
<p>The content from all coding lectures has been very interesting and overall exciting to learn about. It has been something new for me to learn and understand that I can also then use and apply to my design career in the near future. It's been interesting learning about the use of web design and appreciating the skill and ability it takes to code and create big major websites. The coding lectures have been helpful and will be useful when playing around in github and creating my blog website. I’m excited to start creating my blog and applying all the new skills I have learnt from the coding lectures. 
</p>
<br>
<h4>Week 12: Course Wrap-up & The Future of Web Design</h4>
<p>Overall I have really enjoyed this course, from the assignments I have completed to the content I have learnt. I can walk away from this course with a new skill and interest in web design and coding as well appreciation for the work and effort web designers do to create their designs. Looking back on my first blog and talking about what I wanted to learn and gain from this course, I can say that I have learnt more than I can imagine and have built a new skill set I can apply as a designer. </p>
